Model-View-Controller(MVC)
- used to develop user interface that divide the application to 3 interconnected components:
    * Model
    * View
    * Controller
- This helps in organizing the code and making it more maintainable and scalable
Model:
- rep. data and business logic of the application
- interacts with the database
View:
- rep. the UI of the application -> html templates, JSON responses
Controller:
- Handles user input and interacts with the model to fetch or updates data then selects a view to render the UI
